From FASTQ to the analysis-ready variant-containing TSV file 


In this tutorial, starting from the raw sequencing data, I will work you through some simple steps to get the final list of SNPs and Indels in the samples with detailed annotation. To do this, we will take advantage of the nf-core/sarek pipeline.



## Step 1: Run the nf-core/sarek pipeline
We are going to use the RLS sequencing data generated by Illumina platform.

First, you will need to prepare a sample.tsv file indicating the samples
